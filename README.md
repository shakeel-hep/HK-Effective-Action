# HK-Effective-Action
This repository contains files aiding the calculation of effective action obtained after integrating out non-degenerate heavy fields in the Heat Kernel formalism.

We have uploaded one example notebook file which describes the steps of computing the coefficients. One can just import the .m files to bypass the code and still check the result. If you want the code please write to us.
